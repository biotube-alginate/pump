###  Roller STL Files for 3D Print

The STL files in the `roller` directory are derived from a 3D model originally published on Thingiverse: [Original Roller Design by norm8332 on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1721305). We have modified the wheel component of the original design to better accommodate the removal of the core from alginate tubes.
